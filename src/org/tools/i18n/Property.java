 * New composition of the Properties class which extends the functionality. It
 * uses the very same properties files. Conversions to integer are done
 * automatically. We can set a parent which then is used as fallback or master
 * source (implementing part of functionality from ResourceBundle without all
 * the overhead).
 *
 * Comment: The Properties class itself has shortcomings, one is that it is
 * based on a Hashtable<Object, Object> but anyway stores only strings, the
 * other that the order in the file cannot be made alphabetically because of the
 * interplay of the store function of Properties and the Hashtable. However, for
 * keeping the compatibility, we leave it as it is.
